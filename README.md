# Detecting-Pneumonia-from-chest-X-rays
In this project we are classifying chest X-rays as Pneumonia or Normal by looking at the X-ray images. In this end-to-end project,We are dealing with image dataset 
and performing data processing and augmentation as and when required. Creating and training Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow 2.0.
Dataset is available on kaggle. Which is already divided into test,train and validation folders. Each folder is further divided into two folders:Normal and Pneumonia
.The dataset contains 3 types of images: Normal,Bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia chest X-rays.

There can be two approaches to solve this problem. First we can build model from scratch and train it on dataset and second we can use pretrained model like ResNet50 or 
other pretrained model. I have tried both the approaches.

Dataset is available on:
